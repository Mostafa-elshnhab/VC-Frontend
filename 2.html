                        Raised in Pennsylvania, Thandi views the world of her mother’s
                        childhood in Johannesburg as both impossibly distant and ever present.
                         She is an outsider wherever she goes, caught between being black and white,
                        American and not. She tries to connect these dislocated pieces of her life,
                        and as her mother succumbs to cancer,Thandi searches for an anchor—someone, or something, to love.

                Sleep is one of the most important but least understood 
                aspects of our life, wellness, and longevity. Until very recently, 
                science had no answer to the question of why we sleep, or what good it served,
                 or why we suffer such devastating health consequences when we don't sleep. 
                 Compared to the other basic drives in life—eating, drinking,
                 and reproducing—the purpose of sleep remained elusive.
